# Wearable Technology Survey


### SUMMARY
Based on my **Wearable Technology Survey** with 42 participants, More than half did not own wearables, 63% and 36.7% do own a wearable device. I found that more of my participants were female 66.7% and Male were 33.3%.  
More than half of the participants were in the age range of 25-34 66.7% and 16.7 were in the age category of 35-44.
It seems that whether or not the participants owned a wearable device they shared the same concerns in regard to health 53.3% and in second was cost 33.3%.

Owners of wearable devices selected Fitness as being the main reason for using a wearable device, which was 86.7%. Next in line was the fact that wearable devices are popular for their handsfree capabilities, 73.3% as well as the convenience of the device at $53.3%. 26.7% of those owners shared that at least 4 of their family members also own a wearable device. 
Data shows that more than half f the owners of wearables use their devices everyday, 66.7%. 46.7% of the wearable owners showed that the Brand reputation was important in regard to deciding which device to purchase. 40% of those indicated that it was gifted to them. Results showed 46.7% were very satisfied with their selected device.

48.1% Non owners indicated that the cost was the main reason why they do not own a wearable device but at the same time showed interest (77.8%)that wanting a waterproof feature would prompt them to purchase one. I imagine the waterproof feature can be costly when making the products. *I found it interesting that non owners were concerned about cost but were drawn to what may seem like an expensive feature.
33.3% indicated that they believed they would not put their device to as much use, possibly viewing it as a “waste of money”.*

**Apple wins again!** 43.5% of non owners say they would purchase Apple devices and 26.1 would purchase Samsung. Both brands are high end and popular in the tech/electronic world. 1% would be happy with Fitbit which is another brand that has climbed it’s way up into the industry. 
The profession demographics varied greatly ranging from military to teachers, construction works to medical assistant. Most of my participants reside California and Texas. 
Unfortunately only 61.1% of people gave me permission to follow up with them for more questions. I feel like the larger percent of non owners definitely affected this.
